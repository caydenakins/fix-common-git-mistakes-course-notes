# egghead.io Fix Common Git Mistakes Course Notes

![](git-mistakes.png)


This repo contains notes taken from Chris Achard's
[Fix Common Git Mistakes Course](https://egghead.io/courses/fix-common-git-mistakes).

This workshop will explain the common mistakes many people make when utilizing
Git. It will begin by breaking down states in which a file can exist and build
on it from there. When you complete this workshop, you can expect to never have
to worry about losing data or messing up a repo again.

There will be a link to the lesson at the top of each individual note page with
a link to resources at the bottom. Most of it is a transcription, with a few
added points for clarification. This is a public resource, so feel free to
contribute.
